# Merge Conflict Example Repo

This repository serves as an example for resolving merge conflicts in Git.

## Overview

In this repository, there are two branches:

- `main`: Contains content related to the main branch.
- `dev`: Contains content specific to the development branch.

Both branches contain a file called `index.html` that has different content. When you try to merge the `dev` branch into `main`, a merge conflict will occur.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to try to resolve the conflict.
